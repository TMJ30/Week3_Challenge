Used the concepts learned to complete two Python csv challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

**PyBank Assignment**:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

**PyBank**:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote


**Code Sources**:

with open(load_output, "a") as txt_file: #print into text file without overwritting pervious outputs: found this on google AI generated answer

if changes > highest_in["change"]: #if current value of changes is greater than highest change stored in highes_in --> from in class work through

----->highest_in["month"] = read[0]:

----->highest_in["change"] = changes:
